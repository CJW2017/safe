Your computer is like your home.

In your home,k you should feel comfortable having most of you things freely and easily accesible. (cookware, television, clothes, decorations, etc.)

Though, you probably also have things that are just to private or valuable to casually leave lying around. (jewelry, legal documents, money)

In your computer, you might also have things that you consider highly private or valuable. How can you protect them? (passwords, tax returns)

That's where Safe comes in.

Safe is an application that makes encrypting your files super easy!

Encryption renders your files completely unreadable to anyone who doesn't have the password. (hackers, spies)

Use Safe just like you would use a normal folder. Behind the scenes, Safe is automatically encrypting your files. Safe never stores anything in readable form.

Safe is 100% free software. Not only is it free in the "Free beer" sense but it's also free in the "Freedom" sense. ALl the code that makes up Safe is available for you to read, verify, modify, and distribute at your will.
